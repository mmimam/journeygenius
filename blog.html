                <h2>How AI is Revolutionizing Travel Planning</h2>
                <p>The travel industry is undergoing a transformation as artificial intelligence becomes more integrated into how we plan and experience our trips. Instead of scrolling through endless lists of hotels and tours, travellers are beginning to rely on AI‑powered agents that understand their interests and constraints.</p>
                <p>These systems analyse past travel behaviour, preferences for pace and budget, and even reading habits to recommend destinations and experiences that resonate. On a practical level, AI can automatically rebook you when a flight is delayed or suggest alternate activities if weather ruins your plans. Over time, the agent feels more like a trusted companion than a piece of software.</p>
                <p>At JourneyGenius, we believe that this blend of personalization and automation will open up travel to more people and help them explore the world in a deeper, more meaningful way. Whether you're looking for local foodie adventures or peaceful hiking trails, AI ensures you spend more time enjoying the journey and less time planning it.</p>

                <h2>Planning a Family Trip? Let AI Lend a Hand</h2>
                <p>Travelling with family can be rewarding but challenging. Coordinating diverse interests and energy levels often means someone compromises. An AI travel agent can simplify that balancing act.</p>
                <p>By collecting input from every family member and analysing patterns from similar trips, AI can craft itineraries that include interactive museums for kids, coffee breaks for parents, and flexible timing that accounts for nap schedules and unexpected delays.</p>
                <p>When preferences clash—like a teenager who wants extreme sports and a grandparent who prefers cultural tours—AI can find creative ways to satisfy both, perhaps by scheduling a morning of zip‑lining followed by a leisurely afternoon food tour. The result? Happy memories for everyone and a more harmonious trip.</p>
